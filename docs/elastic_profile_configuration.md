# Create an elastic agent profile for ECS

The elastic agent profile, apart from having docker container configurations, provides an ability to configure an EC2 Instance. This would be useful in cases where a docker container cannot be created on the EC2 Instance provisioned using configurations provided in the cluster profile.

* Navigate to **_Admin > Elastic Agent Configurations_** in the main menu
* Click the **_+ Elastic Agent Profile_** button to create a new elastic agent profile within the specified cluster.

**_Note:_** *Configuration settings marked with (\*) are mandatory*

## Container configuration

Specify the properties for docker container(s) which will be used to spawn ECS elastic agents for GoCD.

![Alt text](images/elastic-agent-profile/container_configuration.png "Container configuration")

1. **Profile ID:** Specify a unique ID for this profile.

2. **Cluster Profile ID:** This will be auto populated as you are creating elastic agent profile within the cluster profile.

3. **Docker image (mandatory)** Docker image to spin up the container. List of pre-built docker images for GoCD agents are available [here](https://www.gocd.org/download/#docker). Here is information to [build your own docker images](elastic_agent_images.md).

4. **Hard memory limit for container (mandatory)** The maximum amount of memory that container is allowed to use. This field takes a positive integer, followed by a suffix of B, K, M, G and T to indicate bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes or terabytes respectively. [Read more about docker container memory](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/resource_constraints/#memory).

5. **Reserved memory for container (mandatory)** The docker container will start with this amount of memory. This option is only available for `Linux` platform. This field takes a positive integer, followed by a suffix of B, K, M, G and T to indicate bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes or terabytes respectively. [Read more about docker container memory](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/).

6. **CPU (mandatory)** The number of cpu units to reserve for the container. An EC2 instance has 1024 cpu units for every CPU core. This parameter specifies the minimum amount of CPU to reserve for a container. [Read more about docker CPU constraints](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/resource_constraints/#cpu).
    - **Linux:** If set to 0, container will only use unallocated CPU units. Unallocated CPU units are split equally between all containers.
    - **Windows:** We recommend using at least **1024 CPU units (1 core)** for Windows. Allocating lesser CPU units (including 0) will result in very slow running container.

7. **Task role arn:** Name of the IAM role to associate with the agent container. This can have any permission that is required by the given job. At the bare minimum your role must permit action `sts:AssumeRole` and allow access to `ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com` service.
    > Bare minimum role template

      ```json
      {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
          {
            "Sid": "",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
              "Service": "ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

8. **Execution role arn:** Name of the IAM role to associate with the agent container when using FARGATE. At the bare minimum your role must permit the following.
    > Bare minimum role template

      ```json
      {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
          {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
              "ecr:GetAuthorizationToken",
              "ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability",
              "ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer",
              "ecr:BatchGetImage",
              "logs:CreateLogStream",
              "logs:PutLogEvents"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
          }
        ]
      }      
      ```

9. **Mount Docker Socket:** Mounts the host `/var/run/docker.sock` to docker container.

NOTE: This will be forced OFF when setting FARGATE to True. If you need to build docker containers while inside of Fargate tasks, please use `kaniko` or `buildah`.

10. **Privileged:** When this parameter is true, the container is given elevated privileges on the host container instance. This is useful to run the docker in docker workflow. This can have security implications (since all docker containers can access the host docker server).

11. **Fargate** When this parameter is true, the container runs on ECS Fargate and does not run on ECS+EC2. It also ignores `Privileged`, because ECS Fargate tasks cannot be set to run under privileged mode. If we are using FARGATE, you must set `Execution role arn`.

12. **Docker Command:** Specify the command to run in the container. Enter one parameter per line. This allows you to override the `CMD` that is specified in the `Dockerfile`, or provide one in case the `Dockerfile` does not contain a `CMD`. Read more about [docker's CMD](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd).

13. **Environment Variables:** Specify the environment variables. Enter one variable per line. This allows you to override the `ENV` that is specified in the `Dockerfile`, or provide new environment variables in case the `Dockerfile` does not contain any `ENV`. Read more about [docker's ENV](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#env).
    - Environment variables are resolved in following order:
      1. **_Elastic Profile:_** This will override the variable value specified in the cluster profile and `Dockerfile`.
      2. **_Plugin Settings:_** This will override the variable value specified in `Dockerfile`.
      3. **_Dockerfile:_** Variables defined in the `Dockerfile` have low precedence over other two. For example, variable `Foo` defined in the cluster profile or elastic profile will override the variable with the same name defined in `Dockerfile`.

14. **Bind Mount:** Use bind mounts to mount one or more files or directories from the host machine on to the container. The BindMount configuration requires the following information:
  - **_Name:_** Name of the volume.
  - **_SourcePath:_** The path from the host machine that needs to be mounted on the container.
  - **_ContainerPath:_** The path on the container to mount the volume at.

    > Example BindMount Configuration

       ```json
         [
           {
             "Name": "data",
             "SourcePath": "/ecs/data",
             "ContainerPath": "/var/data"
           }
         ]
       ```

NOTE: When using FARGATE, Bind Mount is disabled in this initial version. SourcePath is not a valid parameter, and the development time to make it work was not in the plans for right now.

## EC2 Instance Configuration

Specify the configuration for the EC2 instance. This is optional. If specified, then the docker container(s) will be spawned on the EC2 instance matching the specified configuration. Otherwise, it will be spawned on an EC2 instance created using the configuration specified in the corresponding cluster profile.

![Alt text](images/elastic-agent-profile/ec2_instance_configuration.png "EC2 Instance configuration")

1. **AMI ID:** This AMI ID will be used to spin up EC2 instances that will run docker containers with this profile. If left unspecified, the default AMI ID configured in the cluster profile will be used to spin up an EC2 instance. Read more about [ECS optimized AMIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html) for [Linux](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_container_instance.html) and [Windows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ECS_Windows_getting_started.html#launch_windows_container_instance).

2. **Instance type:** This instance type will be used to spin up EC2 instances that will run docker containers with this profile. If left unspecified, the default instance type configured in the cluster profile will be used to spin up an EC2 instance. Read more about [EC2 Instance Type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html).

3. **IAM instance profile:** The name of the IAM profile that will allow the ECS agent to make calls to AWS on your behalf. Please refer to [pre-requisites](installation.md) for more information. If left unspecified, the `IAM Instance Profile` configured in the cluster profile will be used to spin up an EC2 instance. Read more about [IAM Instance Profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/instance_IAM_role.html).

4. **Subnet id(s):** Enter comma separated subnet ids. If multiple subnet ids are specified, the subnet having the least number of EC2 instances will be used to spin up a new EC2 instance. If left unspecified, the `Subnet id(s)` configured in the cluster profile will be used to spin up an EC2 instance. Read more about [VPCs & Subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html).

5. **Security Group Id(s):**  Enter comma separated security group ids. EC2 instances will be assigned the security groups(s) specified here. If left unspecified, the `Security Group Id(s)` configured in the cluster profile will be used to spin up an EC2 instance. Read more about [VP Security Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html).

6. **Spot Instance Configuration**
   - **Run As Spot Instance:** On selecting this option the plugin will run a docker container on an EC2 Spot Instance.
   - **Spot Price:** The maximum price per hour that you are willing to pay for the Spot Instance. If not provided defaults to `On-Demand` Price.
   - **Spot Request Expires After (in minutes):** The plugin supports Spot Instances of type `one-time`. `Spot Request Expires After (in minutes)` property is used to set the validity of the Spot Instance request from the time the request is created. Defaults to `5` (minutes).

**Note:** Spot Instances can be terminated automatically by AWS. This plugin does not track Spot Instance interruption notices. On an instance termination, all jobs running on the spot instance will be eventually re-scheduled.
